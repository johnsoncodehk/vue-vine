# Macros

Macros are some special functions that only be meaningful in compile time, they're hints for Vine compiler to transform corresponding component properties.

The type definition of these macros can be found in [our Github repo](https://github.com/vue-vine/vue-vine/blob/main/packages/vue-vine/types/macros.d.ts).

## `vineProp`

Define a component prop. it's inspired from [Vue Macros](https://vue-macros.sxzz.moe/macros/define-prop.html), but with some differences:

- For props doesn't need a default value, you must pass a type argument to it.
- `vineProp`'s first parameter is the prop's validator, it's optional.

```vue-vine
const foo = vineProp<string>()
const title = vineProp<string>(value => value.startsWith('#'))
```

- For props with default value, you can use `vineProp.withDefault`, and the validator becomes the second parameter.

  Because of the ability of TypeScript to infer the type of default value, you don't need to pass the type argument to it.

  Except any `boolean` type default value. Vine indeed ignore the type of props in compile time, but there is a restriction from Vue's "Boolean Cast" mechanism, that said, in compile time, we must know whether a prop is a boolean or not, in order to determine how to handle a prop passing like this: `<MyComponent foo />`. In Web standard HTML, value of attribute `foo` is actually empty string.

  So when you really need a boolean prop, you shouldn't pass a `boolean` variable as default value, only `true` or `false` literal works. Although TypeScript can infer, but Vine compiler doesn't embed a TypeScript compiler, so it's not possible to get that information.

```vue-vine
const foo = vineProp.withDefault('bar')
const bool = vineProp.withDefault(false)
```

## `vineEmits`

Define `emits` for the component, the usage is quite similar to the official version.

This macro has zero parameter, and returns the emits function, you **must** define a variable to accept the return value.

```vue-vine
const myEmits = vineEmits<{
  update: [foo: string, bar: number]
}>()

myEmits('update', 'foo', 1)
```

## `vineExpose`

This macro is just an alias of the official `defineExpose` macro, with the same usage.

Check the description in [corresponding secion](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#defineexpose) on Vue.js official documentaion.

## `vineOptions`

This macro only supports you to define 2 important Vue component options: `name` and `inheritAttrs`.

```vue-vine
vineOptions({
  name: 'MyComponent',
  inheritAttrs: false
})
```

## `vineStyle`

It's a macro for defining styles, alternative to SFC's `<style>` block. If you need `scoped` for your component, you can use `vineStyle.scoped` instead.

`vineStyle` is not allowed to be called outside a VCF, and it's not allowed to be called more than once in a VCF.

You can also specify any CSS processor language you want, check the examples below:

```vue-vine
vineStyle(scss`
  .foo {
    color: red;
    .bar {
      background: yellow;
    }
  }
`)
```
